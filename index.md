### Welcome

This ePortfolio represents my time at Southern New Hampshire and the applied skills and abilites in my capstone course. In this we took three existing projects and enchanced them each with a different computer science focused area in mind. This portfolio is also designed with professional quality in mind and to show my abilities to present content and data in a manner that is appropiate and consumable to the audience. 

### Table of Contents

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

### Professional Self-Assessment

This is a placeholder...

### Code Review

In this code review video, I go over the three projects I will cover and make enhancements for. I perform a typical code review, where the developer reviews his code changes with a peer or lead developer. Code reviews are a common practice in code development roles and are done in order to make sure code quality standards are being held and any discrepancies or overlooks can be caught along side a peer. The acceptance of a peer or lead can help boost confidence as well and can reduce the blame of any mishap being pinned on a single person when the code change has been filtered through multiple eyes before being accepted.

### Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

This Enhancement is on an Andriod application based on Java+Kotlin developed on Andriod Studio. In this course, CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming, My app is named Janus after the Roman god of beginnings and ends, it is designed to be an Event Tracker and the enhancement I gave it was a UI design for SMS and Email notifications. I aimed to show that I could build a UI on Andriod Studio and imlpiment some logic as well that would check and make sure a valid phone number and email is given. Below you will see the added layout and the validation errors that are also configured in the app.

### Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure

This Enhancement is based around JUnit testing. This course, CS-320 Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance, was simply about data structures and how to create JUnit testcases to validate these data structures. I enhancemented the class for Appointment and gave it a large amount of elements, some with different requirements, data types, and logic around it. Below you will find images of the class atributes, the datatypes and validations given, and the tests created and success results.

### Enhancement Three: Databases

This Enhancement is based around MongoDB. In this course, CS-465 Full Stack Development I, we created a MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) full-stack application. There is an admin SPA (single-page application) that allows admins to add new trips or modify existing trips through this UI. The new enhancement is I added a logic to the user database to store the user role with the permission this user has. The SPA can only be logged in with the credentials of a user that has the admin user role.
